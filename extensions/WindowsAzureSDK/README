This extension allows other extensions to utilise the Windows Azure cloud service.

Installation
============

1) Install via Composer

Open up a terminal and run the following command in your extension directory (e.g. $IP/extensions/WindowsAzureSDK).

php composer.phar install

This will dowload and install the latest version of the Windows Azure SDK for PHP and its dependencies.

2) Add to LocalSettings.php

Open up your LocalSettings.php file in a text editor and append the following line somewhere at the end of it.

require_once( "$IP/extensions/WindowsAzureSDK/WindowsAzureSDK.php" );

That's it! You can check whether this extension was properly installed by going to the Speical:Version page on your wiki.
